Folder Structure Generator

This Python script generates a visual representation of the folder structure for a given directory. It traverses through the directory's subfolders and files, printing the structure in the terminal and saving it to a text file.

Features:
- Displays the hierarchy of folders and files using ASCII characters.
- Customizable list of folders to skip the contents of, e.g., "node_modules".
- Provides an option to exclude specific folders while still including them in the structure.

Usage:
1. Run the script and input the path of the directory you want to visualize.
2. The script will print the folder structure in the terminal and save it to 'folder_structure.txt'.

Feel free to use and modify this script to suit your needs.
